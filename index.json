The Quantum Impact on Societal Security consortium will analyse the ethical, legal and societal impact of this upcoming society-wide transition. The consortium’s objective is to contribute to the creation of a Dutch ecosystem where quantum-safe cryptography can thrive, and mobilize this ecosystem to align technological applications with ethical, legal, and social values. Quantum Impact on Societal Security aimss to create wide public awareness and use citizen feedback to develop responsible policies and regulations. The project’s ambition is to be a game-changer by incentivising key economic and societal advantages of adoption of responsible quantum-safe cryptography early on and by galvanizing policymakers into action, so that the Netherlands will gain a leading role in setting the international agenda for quantum-safe cryptography for society.\nQuantum Impact on Societal Security has four scientific aims: First, to identify technical and societal requirements on innovation policies for quantum-safe cryptography: which enables an interactive approach to responsible innovation, in real time as the technology develops. Second, to understand the dynamics of knowledge in research and innovation ecosystems. Third, to draft novel innovation policies that satisfy the societal requirements for the financial and government sectors, clarifying their legal underpinning. Fourth, to link the development of new cryptographic standards to the subsequent stakeholder dynamics and its geopolitical consequences.\nThis project runs from 2023 to 2027.\n","date":1652659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652659200,"objectID":"bb1a201e91ef425a3a605a13a5539bd7","permalink":"https://ivi.uva.nl/tcs/project/qiss/","publishdate":"2022-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tcs/project/qiss/","section":"project","summary":"NWA project","tags":null,"title":"Quantum Impact on Societal Security (QISS)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Christian Schaffner","John van de Wetering"],"categories":null,"content":"The goal of Action Line 3 of QuantumDelta NL is to create a quantum-versed work force.

Are you willing to take on the challenge of securing the next generation of computer systems and networks? Do you like to work in a team of young researchers? We are seeking a PhD candidate who is interested in interdisciplinary research on side-channel attacks against quantum devices used in quantum networks and beyond.\nQuantum technologies are being developed at a fast page. On the one hand, progress on the development of quantum computers poses a serious threat for our security infrastructure, especially for public-key cryptography. On the other hand, quantum components bring novel opportunities since they will be integrated in our networks and could bring novel security functionalities. However, quantum components are mostly experimental, and their security is yet to be studied and assessed in depth. In particular, little is known about their susceptibility against side-channel and physical attacks and, as a direct consequence, we do not know if and which countermeasures can be applied.\nThis PhD position will study the problem of side channels and physical attacks against quantum devices, understanding the extent to which they could be considered a threat and exploring potential methodologies to counteract and mitigate them. In collaboration with experimental physicists, experiments on real quantum devices are expected to be carried out to assess their robustness.\nThe PhD position will be within the Theory of Computer Science (TCS) group but will be carried out in close collaboration with the Complex Cyber Infrastructure (CCI) group and the multiscale network (MNS) groups of the Informatics Institute. The position is a part of the Quantum Delta NL Groeifonds project CAT-2, development of a national quantum network and will also involve collaboration with the experimental and theoretical partners of the CAT-2 project.\nWhat are you going to do? Tasks and responsibilities You are expected to:\ncarry out original research in the field of design for security; have strong analytical and technical skills; have an interdisciplinary mindset and an open and proactive personality in interacting with researchers from different disciplines; be active in the fundamental and/or applied research area, publishing in high level-international journals and presenting at leading conferences; take part in ongoing educational activities, such as assisting in a course and guiding student thesis projects, at the BSc or MSc level; be open to collaborations with other groups, institutes and/or companies by contributing expertise to (joint) research projects. What do you have to offer? Your experience and profile: A MSc degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering (or related disciplines); A strong scientific interest in security, in particular in side-channel and physical attacks; The willingness to work in a highly international research team; Fluency in oral and written English and good presentation skills; Prior experience in side-channel and physical attacks; Basic knowledge of quantum technologies is a plus (but not required). Our offer A temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). The preferred starting date is as soon as possible. This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students.\nThe gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,541 in the first year to € 3,247 in the last year (scale P).

We aim to build strong lasting links between strategically selected industry and academic partners, in different disciplines, via the development of novel technologies for practical applications in quantum and post-quantum cryptography. In parallel, we will also combine, via a collaborative long-term interdisciplinary approach, expertise in the two communities to address key fundamental problems in secure communications, and the important applications therein. The planned training network will provide research and training opportunities to a new generation of doctoral students, who, in the long-run, shall address the Grand Challenge of providing “Quantum-Safe Internet”, i.e., a communication infrastructure that is secure against not only classical attacks but also those enabled by quantum technologies. Internet security, which heavily relies on computational complexity assumptions, is seriously threatened by advancements in quantum computing technologies. Indeed, we have recently witnessed a wave of key developments in this direction by a number of IT giants, e.g., Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Intel. This particularly threatens applications that require long-term security. The number of such applications is continuously growing as more and more of our private information is stored and communicated in a digital way, e.g., electronic health records, which are now required by European legislation to remain secure for a long time. This requires us to urgently develop and implement new solutions. In QSI we combine the merits of quantum and post- quantum cryptography as key elements of the future quantum-safe Internet.
